**Follow the conversation. Find your evidence. Answer in your own words.**

A native macOS assistant for interviews, meetings and academic discussions. LiveCopilot transcribes speech, retrieves relevant passages from your documents and streams answer suggestions in a floating window. You can also type a question without starting the microphone.

## Download and requirements

**2.5.0 · 37.98 MB · Universal macOS app · Developer ID signed and Apple notarized**

[Download DMG — Hong Kong mirror](https://livecopilot-downloads-hk.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/releases/v2.5.0/LiveCopilot-2.5.0-macOS-universal.dmg) · [GitHub download and checksums](https://github.com/carey-bk/LiveCopilot/releases/tag/v2.5.0)

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Application | macOS 14 or later; Apple Silicon or Intel |
| Local Laya automatic triggering | Apple Silicon; downloaded separately |
| Apple local speech | macOS 26 or later, supported hardware and language |
| AI answers | Your own API key for a supported analysis service |

The small installer **does not contain Laya weights**. Download the models you choose in the setup guide or Settings → Services. No separate Python, Ollama or Docker installation is needed. Approximate downloads: Zipformer + VAD **200 MB**, BGE-M3 **635 MB**, Laya and its runtime **767 MB**. Installed models require additional disk space and use your Mac's memory and compute.

Open the DMG, drag LiveCopilot into Applications and launch it there. Existing users can choose **LiveCopilot → Check for Updates…** in the application menu. Normal upgrades preserve settings, API keys, documents and history; updating Laya requires a separate model download.

## What is new since 2.3?

| Area | Improvements in 2.5.0 |
|---|---|
| Complete session history | Searchable three-column view, date groups and a chronological timeline of speech, questions, answers and citations. Copy individual messages or export a session as Markdown/TXT. Older transcript-only records remain readable. |
| Better session titles | Automatic naming after a voice session uses the configured analysis API and Q&A context to correct obvious speech homophones in the title. Rename or generate a title again from the context menu. Transcripts are not rewritten. |
| Reliable local models | Real loading/inference self-checks after download, manual checks, copyable diagnostics and specific recovery advice. Embedding initialization uses less initial memory and can fall back from GPU to CPU. |
| Recommended bilingual speech | Zipformer is the recommended local Chinese/English engine, with optional terminology enhancement off by default. Paraformer remains an alternative. |
| Fine-tuned Laya | Updated response-intent weights decide when to answer using a 1,024-token context. Downloads pin an immutable ModelScope revision and verify file sizes and SHA-256 hashes. The analysis API still generates the answer. |
| Clearer native settings | Compact model actions, side-by-side font controls, answer style after API-key settings and a default of five retrieval passages. Background choices apply to the floating window; settings stay white. Capture exclusion defaults off; existing explicit preferences are retained. |

See the [2.5.0 validation report](docs/releases/2.5.0-validation.md) for clean-checkout builds, model checks, notarization and the tested 2.3 → 2.5 in-app update.

## Start your first conversation

1. **Install and open the setup guide.** Choose your interface language and usage mode. The guide can be reopened from General settings.
2. **Prepare speech and local models.** For Chinese/English, start with Zipformer. Add BGE-M3 for document retrieval and Laya for automatic triggering on Apple Silicon. Download only what you need.
3. **Connect your analysis service.** Choose OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi or a compatible streaming Chat Completions endpoint, then save your API key.
4. **Add context if needed.** Import PDF, Markdown, TXT or DOCX into Knowledge. Scanned PDFs need OCR first. Rebuild document indexes after changing the embedding model.
5. **Listen or type.** In-person mode uses the microphone; remote-meeting mode captures system audio with an optional microphone. Grant the relevant macOS permissions. You can also type with listening off.
6. **Review the session.** Read answers and source passages in the floating window, then revisit questions, answers and citations in History.

`⌥H` shows or hides the floating window. Answer, recap and follow-up shortcuts are configurable. Always review important facts and citations.

## Choose where processing happens

| Stage | Available services | What leaves your Mac? |
|---|---|---|
| Speech recognition | Local Zipformer, Paraformer or Apple; OpenAI Live | Local recognition stays on-device. OpenAI Live sends audio to OpenAI. |
| Document indexing and retrieval | Local BGE-M3 or OpenAI Embeddings | BGE-M3 runs locally. OpenAI Embeddings receives indexing/query text; retrieval storage remains local. |
| Automatic response triggering | Local Laya for local speech; OpenAI Live's semantic delegation | Laya's decision runs on-device. Cloud speech follows its provider's data handling. |
| Answer generation and automatic titles | Your selected analysis API | Relevant question/conversation text and selected evidence; automatic titles use session Q&A context. |

For example, **Zipformer + BGE-M3 + DeepSeek** keeps speech recognition and indexing local and uses DeepSeek for answers. That combination does not require an OpenAI key. Local processing has no API usage fee; cloud services may charge your account.

## Privacy and practical limits

- API keys are stored in the local macOS Keychain. Documents, indexes and session history are stored locally. There is no LiveCopilot account or developer-operated relay server.
- Local speech does **not** mean fully offline answers: the chosen analysis provider receives relevant text. Its retention and billing policies apply. Deleting local history cannot retract earlier API requests.
- Screen-sharing/recording exclusion is optional and off by default. Verify it with the actual meeting application; settings and history remain visible to capture.
- No built-in OCR, guaranteed speaker separation, spoken AI responses or cloud backup. Laya may miss a request or trigger incorrectly. Intel app support does not imply Intel support for Laya.

## Development and documentation

Built with Swift/SwiftUI. Full Xcode and XcodeGen are required to build from source:

```bash
./StealthApp/scripts/test-core.sh
./StealthApp/scripts/build.sh
xcodebuild -project StealthApp/LiveCopilot.xcodeproj -scheme LiveCopilot \
  -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath StealthApp/build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test
```

A clean checkout builds the small app without fetching Laya weights. Native runtime dependencies are checksum-pinned. Debug uses a separate bundle identifier. Mock checks need no API key or paid requests. Distribution signing and notarization are separate steps; follow the release guide before packaging.

| Documentation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Components and data flow |
| [Verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md) | Tests and evidence boundaries |
| [Model distribution](docs/MODEL_RELEASE_READINESS.md) | Model pins and release requirements |
| [Release guide](docs/RELEASING.md) | Signing, notarization, packaging and updates |
| [Report an issue](https://github.com/carey-bk/LiveCopilot/issues) | Include app/macOS versions and model diagnostics; omit keys and private conversation text |

Technical documentation is maintained in English. These three README editions describe the same release; the app's interface languages remain Simplified Chinese and English.
